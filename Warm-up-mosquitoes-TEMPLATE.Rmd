# BACKGROUND

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen maintained in a transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes, with occasional leak into humans and horses. “Birds serve as the natural reservoir (amplifying) hosts, while Culex species mosquitoes are the primary vectors that sustain WNV in nature”(Campbell et al., 2002). WNV was first introduced into North America in 1999 and continues to affect people today. As shown in the graph below, house finches appear to have the highest infection rates, suggesting that they may serve as important amplifying hosts.

Mosquito biology is central to understanding WNV transmission. A key difference between male and female mosquitoes is that only females feed on blood, making them the sole transmitters of WNV. To study which bird species mosquitoes are feeding on, and thus which hosts might be driving transmission, mosquitoes must first be collected. In this study, two types of traps were used: gravid traps and CO₂ traps.
Gravid traps use water infused with organic material to produce a strong odor that attracts females ready to lay eggs. Before egg-laying, however, these females must take a blood meal, meaning gravid traps are especially effective at capturing mosquitoes that have already fed on a host. CO₂ traps, on the other hand, emit carbon dioxide to mimic vertebrate respiration and attract host-seeking females. These traps are cheaper, easier to deploy, and can operate for longer periods, though they often capture mosquitoes before they have taken a blood meal.

Once collected, mosquitoes are processed to determine both infection status and feeding history. Pools of mosquitoes are homogenized and tested for WNV using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR is “a laboratory technique for rapidly producing (amplifying) millions to billions of copies of a specific segment of DNA, which can then be studied in greater detail” (Smith, 2024). This involves primers that target specific genome regions, allowing researchers to detect viral presence. Additionally, “gene sequencing can be used to determine the nucleotide order of a genome segment” (CDC, 2024), which helps identify the host species from which the mosquito obtained its blood meal.

If house finches act as key amplifying hosts, then mosquito trapping sites where finches are a common blood meal source should show higher proportions of WNV-positive pools. In the plot below, this prediction is supported: sites with higher rates of finch feedings also cluster at higher values on the y-axis (infection rates), compared to sites where mosquitoes feed less frequently on finches.

```{r horiz-plot,fig.align='left',fig.width=7,fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

par(op)

## Keep the colors mapping for reuse elsewhere
host_species_colors <- species_colors
```

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions

What bird species is acting as a WNV amplifying host in Salt Lake City?

## Hypothesis

House finches are acting as important amplifying hosts of WNV in Salt Lake City.

## Prediction

If house finches function as significant amplifying hosts, we expect that mosquito trapping sites where house finches are a common bloodmeal source will show elevated rates of WNV-positive mosquito pools.
